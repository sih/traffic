Traffic
=======

Data project to parse and process public UK government data on the road traffic network.

This uses public data from the UK Government Data Portal. In order to run the tests you will need to download the predefined traffic locations from http://hatrafficinfo.dft.gov.uk/feeds/datex/England/PredefinedLocationLinks/content.xml and store as predefined-location.xml in ./data.

Run the tests using mvn clean install
